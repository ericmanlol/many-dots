# many-dots

So, I started using linux & vim again as mains so need to get some configs up

I don't have a set plan, instead opting for the organic|scenic route #soulsurfing


##### pre-reqs

1. docker
2. possibly you

##### build & run

`make br`


##### interact

```
# after `make br`, obviously
nvim
```
