# many-dots

So, I started using linux & vim (first time neovim) again as mains so need to get some configs up

I don't have a set plan, instead opting for the organic|scenic route for fun & learning #soulsurfing

##### pre-reqs

1. docker
2. possibly you


##### build & run

```
# clone this repo and then run:
cd many-dots/ && make br`
```

##### interact

```
# after `make br`, obviously
nvim
```
