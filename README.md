# many-dots

So, I started using linux & vim again as mains so need to get some configs up
  - don't you run linux at work everyday?
    - different when you do it for yourself vs. other people's expectations
      - unique nuance of character

I don't have a set plan, instead opting for the organic|scenic route #soulsurfing
